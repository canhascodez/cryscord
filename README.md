# cryscord

[![Tests](https://github.com/canhascodez/cryscord/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/canhascodez/cryscord/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Cryscord is a (WIP) discord library for crystal-lang ðŸ˜¸

## Installation

1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     cryscord:
       github: canhascodez/cryscord
   ```

2. Run `shards install`

## Usage

```crystal
require "cryscord"
```

This is not currently in any kind of usable condition. The Discord API is fairly large and complex, and you need to implement a fair amount of it to be minimally useful.

## Development

I have little expectation that this project will be relevant to anyone else's interests.

## Contributing

1. Fork it (<https://github.com/canhascodez/cryscord/fork>)
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
